## Project Guidelines ##

* Git:
	* Project Description PDF includes what should be committed and what should
	  not be. Place documents which should be committed in the docs/ directory.
	* DO NOT include information about the course in committed files or any
	  activity done on GitHub. This is real, public software and course
	  information is not needed.
	* Use GitHub-flavoured Markdown for textual design-documents. GitHub can
	  automatically preview this.
		* Markdown is simple (Easier than LaTeX by far). Use the following links
		  to learn it.
			* http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics
			* https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown
		* Markdown files have the extension “.md”.
	* Store diagrams in SVG (preferred) or PNG format. DO NOT use JPG or BMP.

* Workflow:
	* Periodically, as needed, full team meetings will take place.
	* Before each iteration, mini-teams will be built of 2 – 4 members of the
	  full team. Each mini-team will be assigned a leader. The leader is
	  responsible to the project lead. If a group becomes unresponsive or a
	  problem is found in the group, the project lead reserves the right to
	  reassign leadership roles.
		* Mini-teams may be broken down if problems arise. In this case, the
		  project lead will take on the leadership role of this mini-team,
		  without actually being a member of it.
		* In the event that mini-teams are not reconstructed at new iterations,
		  the leader of the mini-teams will continue to cycle. No one will lead
		  a mini-team for two iterations consecutively.
	* Each mini-team will be assigned a group of similar tasks to perform.
