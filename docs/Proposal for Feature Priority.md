## Proposal for Feature Priority ##


###Setting Windows for color scheme:###

**Color tab**

- Color option for Stereotype.

-  Preset color at first, possible add color widget later on during production phase for customizable color scheme.

**Stereotype Visibility tab**

- Check box that will turn visibility on or off. 


###Search Windows###

- Search Box where user can enter a search.

- Add a list to display the results and check box for enable visibility (only allows the select result to be render on the UI).


###Modify Existing UI###

- Re-organize the UI for a cleaner look. Add preset layout at first, later on might add a feature that allows user to create custom layout.


###Save Layout Button###


- Allows user to save the layout, when next time the program in launch it will keeps the old later and what was display when user was previously had on the screen.


###Fix the implementation###

- Allows the Visual aspect of the program to run on the same eclipse windows as the code, instead of open a separate eclipse program for the visual. This cut down the resources being use by the program.
