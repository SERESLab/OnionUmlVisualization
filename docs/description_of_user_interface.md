###Diagram View Window###

The diagram viewing window displays all classes from the loaded UML file. User can select classes with a click and drag action from the mouse. Selected classes may be controlled from the UML Diagram Control window. 

###UML Diagram Control Window###

The UML Diagram Control window is parted three ways. 

-The first window partition will hide and show classes from each package. Buttons in this region will select all or none (View All, View None) of the packages in the .classml file, as listed in the table directly below the buttons. The table also lists checkboxes next to the package names, so that the user may select or deselect individual packages. Once all selections (or deselections) have been made, the user should click Update Diagram to send the changes and update the Diagram View window. 

-The second partition is used to control Onion Compaction of loaded classes. The first two buttons on the left (Compact Selected, Expand Selected) will compact, or expand, any currently selected classes. The buttons on the right (Compact All, Expand All, Reset All) will compact all of the classes into onion notation, expand all classes out of onion notation, or return all classes to default. 

-The third partition has visibility preferences, which are also available in the preferences section. Select or deselect the checkbox next to the appropriate labels to display (or hide when deselected) class stereotypes, class fields, and class methods.
